### UPDATE
26/11/23: I'm (@2021030063) giving up on this shit to make models, edit them and whatnot. It's too resource consuming and my pc doesn't give for it. AutoCAD constantly freezes and shit, I'm tired. Unless I get an M3 Max (so a beefy af Mac), I'm not continuing on this bs. If you wanna continue making them, feel free to do so, and I wish you the best of luck ðŸ«¡
I'll still keep on updating this repo however, since @Oliasaew doesn't do such a thing :)))))

# 3D Stuff!
Gang gang, for the business.

## What is all of this?
[FoodCad](FoodCad/) is the place exclusive for the food cutters, nothing more. Inside you can find cookie cutters and even sandwich cutters as of 25/11/23. More things can be added ðŸ˜‰ Only if you're crazy enough though ðŸ¤ª

[LeYah](LeYah/) is for anything bigger than a food cutter or a food shaper, I guess?

[Printer_Info](Printer_Info/) is the directory that stores anything printer-related

## What do I need to get started?
1. Slicer software (any of these two, which are officially supported by me [a.k.a. the one keeping this updated and the owner of the repo: @2021030063]. If you have issues with any other software, I won't help, so you'll have to solve it yourself:D):
    - AnyCubic Slicer: This is easier, since the printer is already in there!:D. Latest releases [here]()

        Here are some links for the 1.2.2 setup:
        - [Win64](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M-41UzyA17VsaHYYroMr3a4sOfyasJsb)
        - [MacOS (Intel only, I think?)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14cLnWd7Z4yOZg0wC5LqKiCmhNpXrlyh2)
        
        Here's the manual, just click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eWvUIdpx4F1n4pbeJnOWPf557bJ3J2jd)
    
    - Ultimaker Cura: The program where you'll set up everything to print, check out the latest releases [here](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/#downloads).

        Here are some links, however, for the 5.5.0 setup:
        - [Win64](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/releases/download/5.5.0/UltiMaker-Cura-5.5.0-win64-X64.exe)
        - [MacOS (Intel)](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/releases/download/5.5.0/UltiMaker-Cura-5.5.0-macos-X64.dmg)
        - [MacOS (ARM64)](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/releases/download/5.5.0/UltiMaker-Cura-5.5.0-macos-ARM64.dmg)

        After you're done with the setup, you need to [install the printer](Printer_Info/Import_How_To.pdf), and lastly you'll need to install the [PLA Cura Profile](Printer_Info/Kobra2-PLA.curaprofile) (the parameter file for the printer in Cura).

2. Models: Basically anything in [FoodCad](FoodCad/) or [LeYah](LeYah/) that is an STL file

3. Filament: Yeah, I ain't helping you on that one

# Pull requests and issues

## Pull requests
- If you've made a file upload or a file change, make a pull request after you have **_at least 5 commits or 5 uploads_** for the **test branch**; that's the one most up-to-date and well, we don't wanna mess up the main branch, do we?
- If you've made significant changes, make a pull request and **DO NOT MERGE STRAIGHT INTO MAIN**, get my approval (@2021030063) first:)

## Issues
- Don't ask stupid questions in the issues tab. The manual for AnyCubic is your friend, and for Ultimaker Cura there are many manuals out there, just look them up in whatever search engine you have (eg. Google, Bing, Duckduck go, etc.).
- If it's just a simple question, ask ChatGPT for answers, it can solve a lot of issues but don't trust it blindly, or you'll suffer a lot lol. **DO NOT MAKE AN ISSUE**
- IF you can't find any relevant info online and/or it's an issue specific to the models provided here, make an issue.
- IF you're working on a project, make an issue.
